  The RISC-V-processor-generator will accept user input via the user typing into
  the terminal in the form of instruction commands or giving the terminal a 
  txt file with instruction. It will have the following functionality: 
  running test cases the user gives or generating test cases for 
  them. This means the test cases generator will generate test cases of the 
  specified instruction for the user.

  The interface of the RISC-V-processor generator is implemented using the
  ANSITerminal.
